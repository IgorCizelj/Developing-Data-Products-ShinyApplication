This repository contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for the Cousera Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course in the Data Science Specialization. The app is based on a data set obtained and described here: =

1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
3. - presentation.Rmd is the Markdown file that generates the presentation describing the shiny app
4. - presentation.html is a HTML compiled from the .Rmd file, and generates the presentation hosted on Neocities here: http://rpubs.com/rkackerman/shinyappproject.
